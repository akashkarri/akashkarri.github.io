									<p>Originally brought on for projects to test the effectiveness of nebulized RNA-interference drugs against asthma and pulmonary fibrosis in mouse models, I worked closely with postdoctoral research fellows at NCSU’s Cruse Lab to be trained on proper handling of live mice and worked on developing an apparatus for the drugs to reach the periphery areas of mouse lungs.</p>
									<p>When one of the pathologists in the lab mentioned to another colleague on how it’s very time consuming to look through slides and identify/count cells of interest, I proposed a new project to develop a Neural Network based tool to identify and locate cells of interest in order to alleviate pathology-related research bottlenecks. With COVID-19 shutting down the university and my other projects, this project became my main research project over the summer. I finished developing the network and am now comparing the network results against pathologists and preparing a manuscript for publication!</p>

									<p>Just to mess around at the beginning of lockdown, I created a system that’s able to read licence plates from images and can be connected to personal security cameras. The accuracy of this system matches other commercial systems and has a lot of potential uses! However, I’ve also made a decision that I will not be showing/giving any parts of this tech to law enforcement, as it could be mishandled to perpetuate the already disastrous discrimination present in many organizations.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Radiation Protection in Deep Space</h2>
									<h4 class="major">RECON MARC-S</h4>

									<p> </p>
									<p>Planning to participate in the NASA HUNCH competition, a group of 4 high school friends and I formed Team RECON to tackle the challenge of protecting against cosmic radiation in deep space. The competition for NASA HUNCH was based around creating a vest with pockets where high density polyethylene sheets could fit over. However, once we created a product, we decided to further it by developing an entire suit (not just a vest with pockets) focused around comfortable protection in deep space. The current state-of-the-art was the AstroRad suit created by the company StemRad, but that too was only a vest. With the goal to enable smooth movement while also having protection, we used Samurai armor as inspiration as a method of overlapping high-density polyethylene “scales” (plus other materials) to maintain protection of the entire body while also providing ample movement ability.</p>
									<p>With this product (named the MARC-S), we also entered in the Conrad Spirit of Innovation competition (and won the Power-Pitch award at the international finals) and presented our design at NASA Langley and Kennedy! If you want to learn more about this project, contact me!</p>

									<p> </p>
									<p>I was a research intern at Duke University’s Gong Lab from June 2018 to February 2019. While there, I worked with other researchers to train/test a 3D Convolutional Neural Network to segment active neurons from 1-photon calcium-imaging videos of in-vivo mice brains. An image of my poster is shown too!</p>
									<p>We genetically encoded the GCaMP protein complex into mice neurons, basically causing a neuron to “light up” whenever an action potential occurs. 2-photon microscopy is usually used to observe the neurons lighting up, but the area covered by that technique is miniscule compared to the area covered in a 1-photon microscopy video. To automate the process of highlighting thousands of neurons from a single area, the Neural Network was developed. With later studies planning to relate various mouse activities to different neurons being active and detected, this tool is one step on the journey of functionally mapping brains.</p>

									<p> </p>
									<p>Competing in the NASA HUNCH competition, a group of 4 high school friends and I formed Team WELIFT to take on the HUNCH challenge developing a single point exercise harness. The Orion spacecraft capsule is too small for the current exercise system used on the International Space Station, so it was necessary to develop a single point harness that was able to connect to the new HULK exercise system that NASA has developed. Using the Glenn Harness (used on the ISS treadmill) as a framework and working with designs from heavy-load backpack companies, we modified the harness to place greater stress on the spine/long bones and supplemented our project with modular attachments that could place stress on the bones while the astronaut is not actively exercising.</p>
									<p>With this harness, we also entered in the Conrad Spirit of Innovation competition (and became international finalists) and presented our design at NASA Langley, Johnson and Kennedy! If you want to learn more about this project, contact me!</p>
